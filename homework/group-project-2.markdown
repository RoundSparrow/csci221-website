I am your customer. Meet my needs. First, figure out what those needs are (i.e., ask me).

You will present about your project, twice, specifically about how you are managing or did manage your team and are ensuring or ensured you met requirements. You will also write a report (2 pages, single-spaced) at the end. Every person turns in his/her own report.

Something bad will happen in the middle of the project. Prepare for it.

## Requirements

- Work in teams of 3-4.
- Every person must commit to the repository. I expect to see branches (at least one per person or feature), and merges.
- You should have a good set of test cases.
- You should document your architecture with class diagrams (UML).
- Take notes about what worked, and what didn't, in your process, team interactions, requirements gathering, testing, etc. You will report about this to the class, and in a short report (2 pages, single-spaced).
- Not all team members will receive the same grade. The grade will be calculated based on the success of the project (meeting requirements), completeness of relevant documentation, completeness of relevant test cases, overall contribution to the team, and quality of the final report presentation and paper.

## Due dates

- **Tue, 4/7, 11:59pm**: Some kind of document about the requirements of the project; some code; designations of which team members work on what features/tasks.
- **Tue, 4/16, 11:59pm**: Mid-project presentations, indicating your goal, how you are making progress, how you are sure you will succeed, etc.
- **Tue, 4/28, 11:59pm**: Final due date for the software (code, tests, documentation) and report. This is a "hard" due date. Nothing will be accepted after this date. Your final presentation will occur on this day in class.
