I am your customer. Meet my needs. First, figure out what those needs are (i.e., ask me).

We will have "standup meetings" at the beginning each class day for the rest of the semester (so don't be late to class). Your team will discuss their progress. Then you'll have time with me as the "customer."

You will write a report (2 pages, single-spaced) at the end. Every person turns in his/her own report.

Something bad will happen in the middle of the project. Prepare for it.

## Requirements

- Work in teams of 3-4.
- Every person must commit to the repository. I expect to see branches (at least one per person or feature), and merges.
- You should maintain a Scrum burndown chart. Show this during each standup meeting.
- You should have a good set of test cases.
- You should document your architecture with class diagrams (UML).
- Take notes about what worked, and what didn't, in your process, team interactions, requirements gathering, testing, etc. You will write about this in a short report (2 pages, single-spaced).
- Not all team members will receive the same grade. The grade will be calculated based on the success of the project (meeting requirements), completeness of relevant documentation, completeness of relevant test cases, overall contribution to the team, and quality of the final paper.

## Due dates

- **Tue, 4/9, 11:59pm**: A plan for each iteration (there are 3 weeks, 3 iterations): include the user stories and indicate who will work on what.
- **Tue, 4/30, 11:59pm**: Final due date for the software (code, tests, documentation) and report. This is a "hard" due date. Nothing will be accepted after this date.
