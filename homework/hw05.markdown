# HW05: Elevator

Make an efficient elevator logic for an arbitrary number of elevators. See code at `/usr/local/csci221sp2016/elevator`. Test script forthcoming.

# Technique

- Add a subclass of ElevatorLogic. Add this class to the Makefile so it's built with the test_elevator code.

# Goal

Make the most responsive elevator logic, according to the output CSV file.
