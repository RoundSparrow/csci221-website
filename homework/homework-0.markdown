Skills needed to complete this assignment:

- How to use [Linux](/lecture/linux.html)
- How to use [git](/lecture/git.html)

# Task 1

The only task for this homework is to create a BitBucket account,
create a git repository, add files to it and make a few commits,
create a tag, and push your changes up to BitBucket.

I will look at your BitBucket account and grade the assignment from
there. You do not submit anything to me.

Here are the steps:

1. Create a free [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) account.

2. Create an ssh key and upload it to your BitBucket account. (For
   help, see Step 6 on the
   [BitBucket documentation page](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set+up+SSH+for+Git).)

3. Create a repository. You might want to call it "csci221-homework0"
   or similar. Make sure it is a "private" repository.

4. Now, in Linux, follow the "basic workflow" instructions in the
   [git](/lecture/git.html) notes to create a repository and push it
   to BitBucket.

   - You are required to have at least two commits (with at least one
     file; I don't care what is written in the file), and at least one
     tag, named exactly "v1.0". Your commit must also have commit
     messages, though for now I don't care what they are.

5. Back at BitBucket, refresh the page so you can see your committed
   files. Now, on the right side, click "Send invitation" and type
   "joshuaeckroth". This allows me to view your repository. I will
   only be able to see commits you have "pushed".

You are now done. When I start grading homework 0, I will visit your
repository and make sure you have at least two commits with messages
and one tag labeled "v1.0".

We will "submit" all homework this way. I will review your repository
and grade whatever code is tagged "v1.0". Later, I might suggest
changes and allow you to resubmit code with the tag "v2.0". And so
on. The group project at the end of the semester will use the team
features of git, and again I will grade your team's "v1.0" code.
