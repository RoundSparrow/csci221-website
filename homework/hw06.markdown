# HW06: Text adventure

Create a "text adventure" game, e.g., like [Zork](http://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2Fzdungeon.z5).

Because each person may create his/her own unique game, there is no test script. Just upload to bitbucket as usual.

## Logic



## Requirements

- Create at least 10 "rooms" with descriptions and various exits
- Support at least two players, who switch turns; create only one Player class to represent a single player, and create two objects for two players
- Create a simple parser that interprets text commands like "go north" or "get lamp"
- Some rooms must have items, which may be picked up by the player
- Keep track of the player's inventory (items the player has picked up) and support a command "inventory" which shows this inventory
- Create another class representing non-player characters (e.g., monsters) that move around the rooms autonomously
- Somehow list the monsters that are in the same room as the player (perhaps the player has to type a command to see this list)

## Optional ideas

- Support basic combat, e.g., use an item to attack a monster and reduce hit points
- Create containers, e.g. bags, chests, etc., which can contain items, and possibly also contain monsters and/or players
- Create a simple conversation engine so you can talk to monsters
- Create a lock/key system so some rooms/containers are locked until a player finds a particular item
