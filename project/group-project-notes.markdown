# Group project notes

Main goal: Create a website that enables volunteers to sign up for openings offered by organizations. The organizations will post their projects, the number of volunteers they need, the kinds of skills those volunteers must possess, etc. Volunteers visit the site to find work opportunities and earn credits by completing a job. Volunteers can also earn "badges" for completing a certain number of jobs, completing enough jobs to earn a skill badge, etc. Organizations may also indicate that their own employees or members (e.g., fraternity members) must complete a certain number of volunteer jobs or hours or earn certain badges.

The site will be called "Helpers Help Me!" and will be hosted at [http://helpers-help.me](http://helpers-help.me), which is actually londo.
