## Some inspiration

> In my life as an architect, I find that the single thing which
> inhibits young professionals, new students most severely, is their
> acceptance of standards that are too low. If I ask a student whether
> her design is as good as Chartres, she often smiles tolerantly at me
> as if to say, "Of course not, that isn't what I am trying to
> do... I could never do that."

> Then, I express my disagreement, and tell her: "That standard must
> be our standard. If you are going to be a builder, no other standard
> is worthwhile. That is what I expect of myself in my own buildings,
> and it is what I expect of my students." Gradually, I show the
> students that they have a right to ask this of themselves, and
> must ask this of themselves. Once that level of standard is in their
> minds, they will be able to figure out, for themselves, how to do
> better, how to make something that is as profound as that.

> Two things emanate from this changed standard. First, the work
> becomes more fun. It is deeper, it never gets tiresome or boring,
> because one can never really attain this standard. One's work
> becomes a lifelong work, and one keeps trying and trying. So it
> becomes very fulfilling, to live in the light of a goal like this.

> But secondly, it does change what people are trying to do. It takes
> away from them the everyday, lower-level aspiration that is purely
> technical in nature, (and which we have come to accept) and replaces
> it with something deep, which will make a real difference to all of
> us that inhabit the earth. -- Christopher Alexander, from the
> Foreword to
> [Patterns of Software](http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/PatternsOfSoftware.pdf)
> by Richard P. Gabriel
